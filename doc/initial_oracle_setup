Assumes you have git and a basic ruby environment installed.  Directions are for a Debian-based Linux distribution, like Ubuntu.

Download my sample rails 3 oracle application on github:
http://github.com/mleone/rails3_oracle_sample

Install latest rubygems.
$ sudo apt-get install rubygems

If you don't have version 1.3.6 or later, run:
$ gem update --system

Some Linux distros won't let you run the above command.  In that case, run:
$ sudo gem install rubygems-update
$ sudo update_rubygems

Install bundler
$ sudo gem install bundler

Install (1) "Linux Oracle Instant Client" and (2) "Instant Client Package - SDK" from 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxsoft-082809.html (have to register) and unzip the installation archives.

In the SDK package, move the contents of the "sdk" directory into the root directory of the instant client:
$ mv path_to_sdk_package/sdk path/to/instantclient_11_2/

Update LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/your/personal/path/to/instantclient_11_2:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

If necessary, make a symlink to libclntsh.so, since the gem looks for that file specificially
$ cd /home/mleone/software_development/instantclient_11_2
$ ln -s libclntsh.so.11.1 libclntsh.so


Navigate to rails app and install the app's gem bundle
$ cd path/to/my/rails/app
$ bundle install
